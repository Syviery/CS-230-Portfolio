>Briefly summarize The Gaming Room client and their software requirements. Who was the client? What type of software did they want you to design?

The client for The Gaming Room was Creative Technology Solutions. They are interested in creating a web-based game which is similar to one of their existing apps. Unfortunately, their current app only supports the Android operating system. They would like to have a game produced which is supported by a vast array of operating systems. The game must be capable of hosting rooms for players to join one another and guess stock drawings drawn from a library.

>What did you do particularly well in developing this documentation?

I am particularly proud of how cohesive the sections of each part feel read together. I often struggle to get my ideas across correctly. This issue can be aggravated when I change topics. Talking about a variety of operating systems is the perfect occasion for my brain to wander. There are certainly sections which did not come across or flow as I intended them to but sometimes that seems to be inevitable. 

>What about the process of working through a design document did you find helpful when developing the code?

Working through a design document prior to beginning a project is helpful when starting a small project but becomes crucial when working as a team or adding to a code base. In this case, it was nice to have aspects of the design doc, such as the UML diagram, which could be references for the “layout” of a project. I found it specifically helpful returning to similar Eclipse projects throughout the two month course so I didn’t feel like I was re-teaching myself the layout.

>If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?

By far, the hardest section for me to complete was the ‘Evaluation’ section of the document. I struggled throughout the document on small parts of sections which felt like I was repeating myself or not staying on the topic when writing. The ‘Evaluation’ section was the portion in which I felt this feeling the most. A large reason for this being that programs I utilize and am familiar with are often released on as many operating systems as possible. The issue we are attempting to solve, releasing on a variety of operating systems, is very important and thus came around interestingly in this instance.

>How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your software design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?

The direction that I chose to approach this issue from was through a cloud-based architecture. This system comes with advantages when a back-end which supports a wider variety of operating systems is needed. Additionally, it seemed like based upon the class material and general discussion that was the proper choice. This decision was important because it impacts the way the rest of the design needs to be considered.

>How did you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a similar software application?

I definitely approached the process attempting to rely heavily on prior knowledge and experience that I had with the topic. This approach helped to start but was somewhat detrimental when trying to focus on subjects I had less personal experience with. Additionally, it can be less fulfilling to explore information on a set path instead of allowing your discoveries to come naturally.
